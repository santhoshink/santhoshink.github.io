    "text": "I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan. My research entails developing statistical and machine learning-based models for the characterization of the disease microenvironment, with a special focus on the tumor-immune microenvironment(TIME).\nMy long-terms goals are to work on problems that have a positive real-world impact, with a focus of tackling problems in the healthcare domain. I am also passionate about understanding the impact of developed CDSS on the overall clinical workflow, and aim to develop frameworks that address the “needs” rather than the “wants” in the healthcare domain."

Burks for inviting me to be a part of this monumental undertaking- especially Julie for seeing this through to the end! And thank you to the rest of the co-authors for their contributions as well. I contributed heavily on the downstream analysis and results section of the paper, including (what I believe to be) a very useful table on what spatial analysis methods one needs to pick based on their computational limitations and biological question under consideration.\nLink to the paper here."
